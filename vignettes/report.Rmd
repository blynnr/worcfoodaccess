## Introduction

A more detailed and informative overview of the projectâ€™s purpose and objectives than what your provided in assignment 6. Approximate maximum length of 400 (individual) to 800 (team, assuming a single package vignette) words.


## Methods

## Results

For analytical projects, describe and illustrate your results, using standard scientific reporting conventions: 1) plan on having 2-4 figures; 2) a similar number of statistical summaries; 3) describe the results in your figures and tables in (up to) 400-800 words (range refers to individual versus team efforts).

## Discussion

For analytical projects, briefly provide your interpretation of the results, any uncertainties/difficulties encountered, and any next steps to be taken. Up to 400-800 words (range refers to individual versus team efforts).
